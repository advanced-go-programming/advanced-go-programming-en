This chapter starts with a brief introduction to the history of the Go language, and a more detailed analysis of the evolution of the "Hello World" program in each of its ancestor languages. Then, it briefly introduces the basic structures represented by arrays, strings, and slices, the process-oriented and duck-object programming embodied by functions, methods, and interfaces, and the Go language's unique concurrent programming model and error-handling philosophy. Finally, several more friendly Go language editors and integrated development environments are recommended for several major development platforms, such as macOS, Windows, and Linux, as good tools can greatly improve our efficiency.
